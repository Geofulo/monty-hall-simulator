### Problem

The concept of the game is that the player see three closed doors - behind one is a car, and behind the other two are goats. The game starts with the player getting to choose a door, without opening it. Then the presenter opens one of the two remaining doors
(but never the one with the car) and shows that this door does not contain
profit. The player is then given another choice, to change or keep the door.
The question is whether the chances of winning increase if the player
changes the door. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

### Solution

App using **React Native + Expo** and styled with [UI Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/).

The users enter how many simulations and if they want to switch the initial option or not, then the app runs the simulations and shows the results.
